Hi $PCMEMBER,

Simon Marlow and I are organising the Haskell Implementers' Workshop to
be co-located with ICFP and the Haskell Symposium this year and we would
like to invite you to join the programme committee.

We ran the workshop in this format last year and it was quite
successful. Here's the website from the workshop last year which
includes last year's call for talks.

http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop

We're planning to run the event in more or less the same way this year.
The scope is:

     * Compilation techniques
     * Language features and extensions
     * Type system implementation
     * Concurrency and parallelism: language design and implementation
     * Performance, optimisation and benchmarking
     * Virtual machines and run-time systems
     * Libraries and Tools

We will not have any proceedings so the workload for programme committee
members should not be too high. We aim to have a programme committee
with six members including the two organisers. The tasks for the
programme committee will be to:

    1. come up with suggestions for speakers to invite
    2. review applications from speakers
    3. have a short online PC meeting to select talks

We expect to have one or two invited speakers and the rest applications
from speakers. We may also have a session of lightning talks organised
on the day (or shortly in advance).

Of course if you have any suggestions for the organisation or running of
the workshop that is also most welcome. Note also that Simon and I
intend to hand over the organisation of the subsequent workshop to new
hands. Members of this year's PC would be first in line if they would
like to take that on.

We look forward to hearing from you,

Duncan and Simon
