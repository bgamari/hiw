        CALL FOR WORKSHOP AND CO-LOCATED EVENT PROPOSALS
                            ICFP 2011
16th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming
                     September 19 - 21, 2011
                          Tokyo, Japan
              http://www.icfpconference.org/icfp2011

The 16th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional
Programming will be held in Tokyo, Japan on September 19-21,
2011.  ICFP provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear
about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and
uses of functional programming.

Proposals are invited for workshops (and other co-located events, such
as tutorials) to be affiliated with ICFP 2011 and sponsored by
SIGPLAN.  These events should be more informal and focused than ICFP
itself, include sessions that enable interaction among the attendees,
and be fairly low-cost.  The preference is for one-day events, but
other schedules can also be considered.

NEW THIS YEAR: The workshops are scheduled to occur on September 18
(the day before ICFP) and September 22-24 (the three days after ICFP).
