Hi $PCMEMBER,

Gregory Collins and I are organising the Haskell Implementers'
Workshop to be co-located with ICFP and the Haskell Symposium this
year and we would like to invite you to join the programme committee.

This will be the fourth year we run this workshop, in this format.
Here's the website from the previous workshops, which includes the
programme for each year.

http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop

We're planning to run the event in more or less the same way this year.
The scope is:

     * Compilation techniques
     * Language features and extensions
     * Type system implementation
     * Concurrency and parallelism: language design and implementation
     * Performance, optimisation and benchmarking
     * Virtual machines and run-time systems
     * Libraries and Tools

We will not have any proceedings so the workload for programme
committee members should not be too high. We aim to have a programme
committee with six members, including the two organisers. The tasks
for the programme committee will be to:

    1. come up with suggestions for speakers to invite
    2. review applications from speakers
    3. have a short online PC meeting to select talks

We hope to have one or two invited speakers and the rest applications
from speakers. We may also have a session of lightning talks organised
on the day (or shortly in advance).

Of course if you have any suggestions for the organisation or running
of the workshop that is also most welcome. Note also that Greg and I
intend to hand over the organisation of the subsequent workshop to new
hands. Members of this year's PC would be first in line if they would
like to take that on.

We look forward to hearing from you,

Johan and Greg
