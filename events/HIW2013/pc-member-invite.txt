Hi $PCMEMBER,

I am organising the Haskell Implementers' Workshop to be co-located
with ICFP and the Haskell Symposium this year and I would like to
invite you to join the program committee.

This will be the fifth year we run this workshop, in this format.
Here's the website from the previous workshops, which includes the
program for each year.

  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop

I'm planning to run the event in more or less the same way this year.
The scope is:

     * Compilation techniques
     * Language features and extensions
     * Type system implementation
     * Concurrency and parallelism: language design and implementation
     * Performance, optimisation and benchmarking
     * Virtual machines and run-time systems
     * Libraries and Tools

We will not have any proceedings so the workload for program
committee members should not be too high. I aim to have a program
committee with six members, including the organiser. The tasks
for the program committee will be to:

    1. come up with suggestions for speakers to invite
    2. review applications from speakers
    3. have a short online PC meeting to select talks

I hope to have one or two invited speakers and the rest applications
from speakers. We may also have a session of lightning talks organised
on the day (or shortly in advance).

Of course if you have any suggestions for the organisation or running
of the workshop that is also most welcome. Note also that
 the organisation of the subsequent workshop will be passed into new
hands.  Members of this year's PC would be first in line if they would
like to take that on.

I look forward to hearing from you,

 --Ryan
