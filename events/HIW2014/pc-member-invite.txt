Hi $PCMEMBER,

Geoff Mainland and I are organising the Haskell Implementers' Workshop 
to be co-located with ICFP and the Haskell Symposium this year and I
would like to invite you to join the program committee.

The workshop is now in its sixth year, with an informal format of
prepared talks and demos as well as impromptu sessions with lightning
talks. You can read about the workshops on these website:
  http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop
to learn more about its format and previous workshops' programmes.

I'm planning to run the event in more or less the same way this year.
We hope to get many talk proposals from speakers, but will certainly
also have one or two invited speakers.

We will not have any proceedings so the workload for program
committee members should not be too high. I aim to have a program
committee with six to seven members, including the organisers.
The tasks for the program committee will be to:

    1. come up with suggestions for speakers to invite
    2. encourage talk proposals in your network
    3. review applications from speakers
    4. have a short online PC meeting to select talks
    5. (if you attend ICFP/HIW) chair one of the HIW sessions

Of course if you have any suggestions for the organisation or running
of the workshop that is also most welcome. The organisation of
subsequent workshops will be passed into new hands, and PC members are
most welcome to express interest.

I look forward to hearing from you,

-- Jost
