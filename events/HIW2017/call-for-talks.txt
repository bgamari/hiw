                     Oxford, UK, 9 September, 2017

Important dates
---------------
Proposal Deadline:  Thursday, 6 July, 2017
Notification:       Thursday, 20 July, 2017
Workshop:           Saturday, 9 September, 2017

The 9th Haskell Implementors' Workshop is to be held alongside ICFP
2017 this year in Oxford. It is a forum for people involved in the
design and development of Haskell implementations, tools, libraries,
and supporting infrastructure, to share their work and discuss future
directions and collaborations with others.

Talks and/or demos are proposed by submitting an abstract, and
selected by a small program committee. There will be no published
proceedings. The workshop will be informal and interactive, with
open spaces in the timetable and room for ad-hoc discussion, demos,
and impromptu short talks.

Scope and target audience
-------------------------

It is important to distinguish the Haskell Implementors' Workshop from
the Haskell Symposium which is also co-located with ICFP 2017. The
Haskell Symposium is for the publication of Haskell-related research. In
contrast, the Haskell Implementors' Workshop will have no proceedings --
although we will aim to make talk videos, slides and presented data
available with the consent of the speakers.

The Implementors' Workshop is an ideal place to describe a Haskell extension,
describe works-in-progress, demo a new Haskell-related tool, or even propose
future lines of Haskell development. Members of the wider Haskell community
encouraged to attend the workshop -- we need your feedback to keep the Haskell
ecosystem thriving. Students working with Haskell are specially encouraged to
share their work.

The scope covers any of the following topics. There may be some topics
that people feel we've missed, so by all means submit a proposal even if
it doesn't fit exactly into one of these buckets:

  * Compilation techniques
  * Language features and extensions
  * Type system implementation
  * Concurrency and parallelism: language design and implementation
  * Performance, optimisation and benchmarking
  * Virtual machines and run-time systems
  * Libraries and tools for development or deployment

Talks
-----

We invite proposals from potential speakers
for talks and demonstrations. We are aiming for 20-minute talks with 5
minutes for questions and changeovers. We want to hear from people
writing compilers, tools, or libraries, people with cool ideas for
directions in which we should take the platform, proposals for new
features to be implemented, and half-baked crazy ideas. Please submit a
talk title and abstract of no more than 300 words.

Submissions should be made via HotCRP. The website is:
  https://icfp-hiw17.hotcrp.com/

We will also have a lightning talks session which will be organised on
the day. These talks will be 5-10 minutes, depending on available time.
Suggested topics for lightning talks are to present a single idea, a
work-in-progress project, a problem to intrigue and perplex Haskell
implementors, or simply to ask for feedback and collaborators.
