Hi $PCMEMBER,

I am organizing the Haskell Implementers' Workshop to be co-located with ICFP
in Oxford this year and I would like to invite you to join the program
committee. The workshop will take place on Saturday, September 9.

The workshop is now in its ninth year, with a format of prepared talks and
demos, as well as impromptu sessions with lightning talks. You can read about
the workshop at http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop

I'm currently planning to orgnaize the event in more or less the same way this
year, but I'm happy to take suggestions for new directions. We hope to get
many talk proposals from speakers. We will certainly also have one or two
invited speakers (e.g., Simon PJ's "State of Haskell" talk).

We will not have any proceedings so the workload for program committee members
should be light. I aim to have a program committee with six to eight members
including me. The tasks for the program committee will be to:

    1. propose any change to the overall format of the workshop
    2. come up with suggestions for speakers to invite
    3. encourage talk proposals in your network
    4. review proposals from speakers
    5. contribute to decision on our HotCRP instance
    6. (if you attend ICFP/HIW) chair one of the HIW sessions

Being on the PC does *not* mean you are required to attend, but of course I'd
love to see you there.

I expect the relevant dates to be:
    Submission deadline: Thursday, July 6
    Notification:        Thursday, July 20

These are expected to squeeze nicely between the Haskell Symposium
notification (June 26) and the ICFP early registration deadline (expected to
be early August / late July). I'm happy to hear suggestions to revise these
dates; they have not been publicized.

The organization of subsequent workshops will be passed into new hands, and PC
members are most welcome to express interest.

So: will you join me on the committee? I hope so!

Looking forward to hearing from you,
Richard
