NAME OF THE WORKSHOP:

   Haskell Implementors' Workshop

GOALS OF THE WORKSHOP:

  The Haskell Implementors' Workshop is a forum for those involved in
  implementing Haskell systems, infrastructure, libraries and tools,
  generally for people involved in implementing Haskell technology, to
  share their work and discuss future directions and collaborations
  with others.
  
  The scope in a bulleted list is:

  * Compilation techniques
  * Language features and extensions
  * Type system implementation
  * Concurrency and parallelism: language design and implementation
  * Performance, optimisation and benchmarking
  * Virtual machines and run-time systems
  * Libraries and Tools

  The workshop does not have proceedings. Talks are proposed by
  submitting an abstract and selected by a small program committee.
  We intend the workshop to have an informal and interactive feel.

  The workshop was held in conjunction with ICFP since 2009, and
  always featured both scheduled 30-minute talks and varying number of
  "lightning talks" contributed on the day.
  Aside from the core "implementors", it also attracts developers
  using Haskell in industry when they attend ICFP.

NAMES OF POTENTIAL PROGRAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS, WITH AFFILIATIONS:

    (Note that this list must be reviewed by SIGPLAN, which includes
    checking for broad representation.

      http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Diversity/

    Since SIGPLAN does sometimes request changes, PC invitations
    should wait until the workshop is approved. You may wish to
    include alternate names, in case not all invitations are accepted
    or SIGPLAN requests changes.


    Please include a little bit of relevant information on each
    proposed PC member, such as affiliation, country, gender, etc.
    If you have any additional information to share on how you
    made your choice, please include that, as it will speed up
    the process of reviewing.

    The ICFP Workshop Chairs will pass this proposed PC on to
    SIGPLAN, and report back if there are any concerns.)

OTHER POTENTIAL ATTENDEES:

   (If desired; mainly for new workshops, as evidence of interest in
   the topic.)

   n/a

PLANS FOR THE CALL FOR PAPERS / PARTICIPATION:

   There will be a CFP asking for potential speakers to submit a talk
   abstract, of similar length to a paper abstract, optionally with
   pointers to supporting materials.  The PC may also invite a
   number of speakers.  There will be a short online PC meeting to
   make the final program selection.

   Calls for participation will be made in the usual way, using
   mailing lists, blogs, newsgroups and so on.

   Rough timeline:
    * CFP towards the end of May; a second CFP sent out at the end of June

    * deadline for contributions mid-July;

    * Online PC meeting shortly after the submission deadline;

    * notification to speakers towards the end of July
      (we aim to stay before the early registration deadline).


EXPECTED NUMBER OF ATTENDEES:

  Based on an average attendance over the last three years, we expect
  around 70 people to attend.
  Participants often choose to attend part of HIW while attending part
  of other workshops as well (workshops synchronise their schedules
  for this purpose).


PLANNED LENGTH OF THE WORKSHOP:

1 day

PLANS FOR PUBLICITY:

   (Including, but not limited to, web pages, mailing lists, and
   newsgroups.)

   Haskell mailing lists, blogs, newsgroups, web site, personal
   invitations.

PLANS FOR A PUBLISHED PROCEEDINGS:

   (Three options are available: no proceedings, proceedings published
   by ACM, or proceedings published as a university technical report.
   In particular, using another publisher is not acceptable under the
   sponsorship terms.)

   No proceedings.
   Abstracts and slides published on the workshop page (wiki, authors to 
   upload). Possibly talk videos published online with speakers' consent.

WORKSHOP WEBSITE:

   (Please include the address that will be used for the workshop
   website, even if this site is not yet active or complete.)

    https://wiki.haskell.org/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop/

VIDEO RECORDING:

  (Do you want the workshop recorded, and if so why. ICFP 2017 has a
  Video Chair, and some events per day can be filmed. It may be
  possible to arrange more cameras and people if needed.)

Video recording would be appreciated as availability of contributions
would otherwise reduce to putting abstract and slides online.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

   (If there is any additional information that you would like
   to make us aware of, please include the details here.

   For example, you may wish to indicate a preference for particular
   dates, or that the workshop should not be run in parallel with
   certain other workshops; in such cases, please also include the
   reasons for your preference.

   As mentioned in the call for proposals, the workshops this year
   will occur on
     September 3 (the day before ICFP) and
     September 7-9 (the three days after ICFP).)


   HIW should not run in parallel with the Haskell Symposium, as most
   HIW attendees will want to go to both.  The best situation is to have
   HIW run one day after the Haskell Symposium, for attendees of Haskell
   Symposium who are not attending ICFP proper. We also have a
   preference for not overlapping with the main CUFP talks.  We can very
   well run in parallel with the CUFP tutorials as these are aimed at
   new FP users which are largely disjoint from the HIW target audience.

   It also may be difficult for me personally to attend 3 September, as
   it would be very advantageous for me to be at my institution (in PA, USA)
   on the first day of classes on Tuesday, 5 September. We are a teaching-oriented
   school, and it is generally expected (though not strictly required) for me
   to be available on the first day of class. I expect to fly to Oxford overnight
   on the night of the 5th. This makes scheduling after ICFP proper highly preferable.
   If this becomes a pain point, let's discuss: I can perhaps get out of the first
   day of class or pass the baton to someone else to organize.
   
SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

   The deadline for workshop proposals is NOVEMBER 19, 2016,
   and the completed form should be emailed to the ICFP 2017
   workshop co-chairs (David Christiansen and Andres Loeh),
   via email to icfp2017-workshops@googlegroups.com.

   Authors of workshop proposals will be notified of acceptance
   or rejection by DECEMBER 18, 2016.

   PLEASE NOTE:
   Organizers should await SIGPLAN approval of the included program
   committee membership prior to sending out PC invitations.
